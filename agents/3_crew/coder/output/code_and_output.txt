```python
num_terms = 10000
total_sum = 0.0

for i in range(num_terms):
    denominator = 2 * i + 1
    term = 1.0 / denominator
    
    # The sign alternates. i=0 (term 1) is positive, i=1 (term 2) is negative, etc.
    if i % 2 == 0:
        total_sum += term
    else:
        total_sum -= term

# The final result is 4 times the sum
result = total_sum * 4

print(f"The sum of the first {num_terms} terms (multiplied by 4) is: {result}")
```

Output of the code:
```
The sum of the first 10000 terms (multiplied by 4) is: 3.1414926535900345
```
